# Ethereum Gas Prices

I try to do it as little as possible, but sometimes I use Ethereum L1. So, instead of actively monitoring gas prices, I built a simple extension that shows me the current Mainnet gas prices and allows me to set a threshold in GWEI. Once the average gas price is less than my threshold, I get a single-time notification.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: This extension is not available via any store for now, you'll have to load it to your browser directly.**

The process is straightforward, it should just involve:
1. Cloning this repository;
2. Going to your browser's "Manage Extensions" page and activate developer mode;
3. Click "Load unpacked" and just select this folder;

If you find bugs, have any feature requests, or want me to make this available via the extension store, feel free to create an issue or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kyre_rs).
