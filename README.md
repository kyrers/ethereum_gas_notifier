# Ethereum Gas Prices

I try to do it as little as possible, but sometimes I use Ethereum L1. So, instead of actively monitoring gas prices, I built a simple extension that shows me the current Mainnet gas prices and allows me to set a threshold in GWEI. Once the average gas price is less than my threshold, I get a single-time notification.
